The following steps should be taken before any attempts to run the code:
0) choose an implementation from the 10 folders. If the code contains multiple
directories, then you must select the same input file.
1) choose an input file to use from InputFiles-Simulations directory
and rename the input file to brdr2dtask.dat (the executable expect the input
file to be brdr2dtask.dat)
2) put brdr2dtask.dat under the same directory with the generated 
executable
3) under that same directory, create an empty data/ directory before you any 
run (if data/ is already present, skip this process)

The above four steps apply to all implementations. For detailed info about how
to run each individual implementation, please refer to the ExperimentsSetup.txt.
